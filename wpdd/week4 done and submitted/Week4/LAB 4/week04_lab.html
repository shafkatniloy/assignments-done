            Make Bega farmer friends in your area. Every climate and growing
            season is different. Learning what specific herbs or vegetables work
            well in your area is essential to success.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start small. Pick a couple of things that are easy and reliable as
            starters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use good soil. Healthy plants cannot grow without it. You may need
            to add compost, nitrogen, or phosphorus. Again, the veterans in your
            area can help you develop good soil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plants need sunlight. Generally vegetables can use as much sunlight
            as possible, but some leafy greens will do well in shaded areas too.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plants need water. It's hard to overwater vegetables, but each plant
            tolerates variations in moisture differently. Generally, a little
            water often is your best bet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep the weeds out. Weeds waste valuable space, moisture and
            nutrients. Weeding your garden also gives you the chance to study
            your crop and make adjustments.
